# This is a placeholder for a beep sound file
# In a real implementation, you would place a .mp3 or .ogg file here
# For demo purposes, the app handles missing file gracefully
# 
# To add a real beep sound:
# 1. Download a short beep sound (0.5-1 second)
# 2. Save it as beep_sound.mp3 or beep_sound.ogg
# 3. Place it in this directory (app/src/main/res/raw/)
# 4. The app will automatically use it when available
